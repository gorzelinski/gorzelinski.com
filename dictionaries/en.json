        "gaming": "My earliest memories are bound to electronics. As a kid, I was thrilled every time I turned on PlayStation. Every startup sounded like going through a portal, entering another digital galaxy. That galaxy absorbed me back then. After 20 years, I am still there.",
        "technology": "Over the years, I have become more and more interested in electronics. When I was a teenager, I got my first phone - a Sony Ericsson k300i. I still remember its specs: 12MB of memory, a VGA camera, and a 65k color display. These numbers were not telling me much back then. But I still liked to analyze them (from mobile phone companies’ flyers) and compare them between different phone models. I am still doing that, to be honest. Nowadays, I follow technological blogs and vlogs.",
        "math": "My passion for numbers did not end there. Math was my favorite subject in school (I was a strange child, I know). After graduating high school (math and physics extended), I started studying at Poznan University of Technology.",
        "university": "I have chosen Electronics and Telecommunications course after many hours of research and careful consideration. Yeah, but...not really. I have based my choice on associations and chance. Fortunately, I was lucky. In university, I could chalk out math equations. I was also solving boolean equations and making electronic circuits based on them. I have programmed some (micro)processors. I have also had the opportunity to configure routers and learn more about computer networks. I was learning about networks not only in university.",
        "internship": "During my studies, I worked at Semcore as SEO Specialist. I started creating websites then. The first of them looked awful, but I liked it. After several months of self-studying, I started working as a Front-end developer at Af Agency. I have had an opportunity to collaborate with brands like Volkswagen or Skoda. I have also experienced the nightmare of creating a newsletter for email clients. Good times. Not ironically.",
        "thesis": "I graduated in 2020 with an engineer title. Now I legitimately can use phrases like “Trust me, I am an engineer.” My thesis was about tools and technologies used to create apps and websites. But it did not end there. I learn about web dev every day. I watch lectures, listen to podcasts, and read books.",
        "books": "“Uncle Bob’s” books occupy some space on my bookshelf. However, I am not limiting myself only to computer science books. My Kallax bends from psychology, philosophy, biography, and especially science books. I also like other media. Games, movies, music - you name it.",
        "activities": "If I do not study and consume media (or coffee), I probably work out, walk, watch memes or think hard about cognitive biases.",
        "position": "I currently work at CKSource as a Software Engineer and Technical Writer to co-create rich editing solutions for the web. There is a chance you've heard of CKEditor - our flagship product."
