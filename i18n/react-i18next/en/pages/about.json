    "childhood": "My earliest memories are bound to electronics. As a kid, I was thrilled every time I turned on PlayStation. Every startup sounded like going through a portal, entering another digital galaxy. That galaxy absorbed me back then. After 20 years, I’m still there.",
    "teenager": "Over the years, I was more and more interested in electronics. When I was a teenager I got my first phone - Sony Ericsson k300i. I still remember its specs: 12MB of memory, VGA camera and 65k colour display. These numbers weren’t telling me much back then. But I still liked to analyze them (from mobile phone companies flyers) and compare them between different phone models. I’m still doing that, to be honest. Nowadays, I follow technological blogs and vlogs.",
    "education": "My passion for numbers didn’t end there. Math was my favourite subject in school (I was a strange child, I know). After graduating high school (math and physics extended), I started studying at Poznan University of Technology.",
    "university": "I’ve chosen Electronics and Telecommunications course after many hours of research and careful consideration. Yeah, um…not really. I’ve based my choice on associations and chance. Fortunately, I was lucky. In university, I still could chalk out math equations. I was also solving boolean equations and making electronic circuits based on them. I’ve programmed some (micro)processors. I’ve also had the opportunity to configure routers and learn more about computer networks. I was learning about networks not only in university.",
    "experience": "During my studies, I worked at Semcore as SEO Specialist. I started creating websites then. The first of them looked awful, but I’ve liked it. After several months of self-studying, I’ve started working as a Front-end developer in Af Agency. I’ve had an opportunity to collaborate with brands like Volkswagen or Skoda. I’ve also experienced the nightmare of creating a newsletter for email clients. Good times. Not ironically.",
    "graduation": "I graduated in 2020 with an engineer title. Now I legitimately can use phrases like “Trust me, I’m an engineer”. My thesis was about tools and technologies used to create apps and websites. But it didn’t end there. I learn about web dev every day. I watch lectures, listen to podcasts and read books.",
    "books": "“Uncle Bob’s” books occupy some space on my bookshelf. However, I’m not limiting myself only to computer science books. My Kallax bends from psychology, philosophy, biography and especially science books. I also like other media. Games, movies, music - you name it.",
    "ending": "If I do not study and consume media (or coffee), I probably work out, walk, watch memes or think hard about cognitive biases."
