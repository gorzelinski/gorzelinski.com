## Services 🛎️

- [Toggl Track](https://track.toggl.com/) - to track the time of my productive activities.
- ~[Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) - I use it for raw notes, grocery lists and, “sudden idea” situations.~
- [Apple Notes](https://www.icloud.com/notes) - I use them for raw, chaotic and more "creative" notes.
- ~[Evernote](https://evernote.com/) - was my primary note-taking tool for a long time (I have some notes there, but I'm switching to Notion).~
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) - I use it for structured notes, tasks, and project management. An all-in-one, productive, and project management tool (todo list, notes, kanban boards, and more).
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - all source code of my site is there. I also use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- ~[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - my hosting CDN. It also has additional features like anonymous analytics.~

- [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com/) - when you receive an email from my Newsletter, it's due to ConvertKit.
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) - a platform with educational courses. I finished some technical tutorials there.

## Tech stack 🛠️

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - rewriting my site was a good opportunity to learn TypeScript. It's a superset of JavaScript with static typing.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - the most popular front-end framework. I was hesitant about JSX at first, but now I like it.
- ~[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) - the page you're looking at was generated by Static Site Generator - Gatsby. It provides performance, scalability, and security out of the box.~
- ~[Gatsby theme i18n & react i18next](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-theme-i18n/) - plugins used for website internationalization.~
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - meta-framework based on React. I used it to build my new website. It's more flexible than Gatsby, but it requires more configuration.
- ~[Style components](https://styled-components.com/) - it helps me create reusable components and design primitives. My design system is consistent because of that.~
- [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/) - CSS-in-JS library with build-time-generated and type-safe (what?) styles. I chose it because it was compatible with React Server Components but stayed for thoughtful API.
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) - an enhanced Markdown. The main format for my content. I use it over Markdown because I can use my custom components with it.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - formats code for me. I can pay less attention to style and yet have perfect formatting.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - lints code for me. It points out when I'm doing something stupid in the code.
- ~[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - framework for unit testing.~
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) - Vite is a French word for "quick." Vitest is noticeably faster than Jest, so I switched it. The migration was pretty easy because the API is similar.
- [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) - utilities that encourage good testing practices (like finding elements via ARIA roles).
- ~[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - a framework for end-to-end testing. You can simulate user behavior with it (clicking, scrolling, etc.).~
- ~[Cypress Axe](https://github.com/component-driven/cypress-axe) - a library for end-to-end accessibility testing. Accessibility is a missed out aspect of many websites.~
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) - it offers full feature parity with Cypress and more, so I switched to it.

## Apps 💻

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - I use Microsoft's code editor to write Microsoft's TS code, with the help of Microsoft's Copilot. I install packages from Microsoft's npm and push them to Microsoft's GitHub. Damn you, Bill Gates! At least I use a MacBook.
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) - I also use the VSC fork that pushed Microsoft to enforce its license. The AI integration here is deeper, I must admit.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - my primary design tool. It is intuitive and component-centric. Creating design systems with it is convenient. It has a growing community that produces many helpful extensions and design files. You can even access it via browser.
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/desktop) - there is a Notion app for most OSes.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - recently, I've been playing with Obsidian for note-taking. I like the performance, simplicity, and graph feature. It shows links between your notes, creating a big interconnected shape similar to a neuron network in a brain.
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - my primary browser. It is often leading when it comes to adopting new web dev features. I use it for browsing and developing the web. Extensions:
  - [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) - for debugging and testing react components.

## Desk setup 🖥️

- **MacBook Pro 16" 2019** - the laptop I use at work. Of the advantages - it is a MacBook. Of the disadvantages - it only has USB-C ports.
- **MacBook Pro 14" M3 Pro** - the laptop I use personally. Apple even listened to their customers because the ports are back with these new laptops. You can plug in an HDMI cable or insert an SDXC card. The speakers, display, and overall build quality are good. The new M3 chips are really performant.
- ~**Desktop PC** - my main computer. Details:~
  - ~**MSI Z170A Gaming Pro Carbon** - Motherboard~
  - ~**MSI GeForce GTX 1070 GAMING X** - GPU~
  - ~**Intel i7 6700K (OC)** - Processor~
  - ~**be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 3** - CPU cooler~
  - ~**Kingston HyperX 16GB** - RAM~
  - ~**GoodRam SSD 240GB** - SSD 1 (Ubuntu)~
  - ~**Adata XPG M.2 256GB** - SSD 2 (Windows 10)~
  - ~**WD Blue 1TB** - HDD~
  - ~**NZXT H440** - Case~
  - ~**SilentiumPC Enduro FM1 Gold 550W** - Power supply~
- **Desktop PC v2.0** - my new, black desktop PC. For Windows 11, Linux and some gaming. Details:
  - **MSI MAG B650 TOMAHAWK WIFI** - Motherboard
  - **Sapphire Nitro+ Radeon RX 9070 XT** - GPU
  - **AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D** - Processor
  - **be quiet! Dark Rock 5** - CPU cooler
  - **GoodRam IRDM, DDR5, 32 GB** - RAM
  - **Samsung 990 PRO 1TB** - SSD
  - **NZXT H6 Flow** - Case
  - **MSI MPG A850G 850W** - Power supply
- **LG 27" 4k HDR (27UK650-W)** - my primary monitor. It has 99% sRGB color coverage, so it produces accurate pictures. With 4k resolution, I can pack a lot of stuff on it, like 3 - 4 code files side by side. Games or movies that use HDR look very vibrant and contrasty.
- **Logitech MX Master 3S** - a wireless, heavier mouse. A mouse dedicated to more productive tasks. I love its electromagnetic scroll. What I love less is the mouse coating - it got a bit sticky over time.
- **Razer Viper Ultimate** - a wireless, lightweight mouse. Good for fps games and other things. It has a similar problem - the coating started peeling on the sides a bit.
- **Razer Gigantus V2** - a mousepad for optical mouses.
- **Razer Pro Type Ultra** - a wireless, full-sized mechanical keyboard. It's advertised for productive tasks but from a gaming brand. Pretty strange combination, but it is surprisingly good. These features make the keyboard great both for office and gaming use.
- **Apple Magic Keyboard** - a keyboard for the MacBook when I use it stationary. A complete opposite of a mechanical keyboard - it's lightweight, flat, and small. But typing on it is also satisfying. Oh, and battery life on this thing is crazy!
- **HyperX Cloud II** - bought it recently, replacing the previous version. Gaming headset with an accurate audio profile that works for consuming other media. Very comfortable.
- **Ikea Bekant** - is my corner desk. It has a big surface to work on and a clever solution for cable management - no single cable lays on the ground.
- **Ikea JÄRVFJÄLLET** - my office chair. I like the aesthetic of it - clean and minimalistic. Not as comfortable as ergonomic chairs, but it offers decent quality for the money.
- **A rubber duck** - helps me with debugging problems.

## Other gadgets 📱

- ~**Samsung Galaxy S20FE** - my primary phone. Almost a flagship, but for two-thirds the price. It has a 120Hz display with good PPI, Snapdragon 865, quality cameras, and other features like induction charging.~
- **iPhone 15** - this year's standard iPhone is pretty similar to the Pro version. The only thing I miss is the 120Hz display. Because a $800 smartphone shouldn't have one, right Apple?
- **iPad Air 11-inch** - I like handwritten notes, but they are not searchable at all. An iPad with an Apple Pen Pro replaced my notebooks. I use it as a starting point for a creative process and read technical documentation on it. It can work as a secondary, wireless screen for MacBook, which is pretty sick, I admit.
- ~**Plantronics BackBeat Fit Sport** - my Bluetooth headphones when I'm on the go. I use them when walking, running, or skipping rope.~
- **Sony WH-1000XM4** - it's an on-ear, noise-canceling pair of headphones. I use them when I want to shut myself off from the world or when my neighbor discovers a handyperson in himself.
- **AirPods Pro (2nd generation)** - I needed a more portable pair of headphones for gym and travel. They seamlessly switch between different Apple devices - it's super convenient.
- **Apple Watch Series 9** - I use it to track my sleep and fitness. It pairs well with my MacBook and iPhone.
- **Amazon Kindle Paperwhite 4** - I like physical books. I prefer them over ebooks. Still, this portable device is perfect when I want to read something and don't want to carry much weight.
- ~**PlayStation 4 Pro** - my current console. I've played on Sony machines since PS1. That won't change because I'll probably buy PlayStation 5. I enjoy their exclusive titles (especially from Naughty Dogs). Console couch co-op is still my favorite type of multiplayer.~
- **PlayStation 5** - yup, I finally bought it. Besides 4k, 60fps (let's say), and HDR, the loading times are impressive. I think now I understand that fuss about built-in SSD. Haptic feedback is also quite an experience. Fundamentally, DualSense simulates your character's actions with different forces and vibrations - like touching the grass. It's hard to explain, so I encourage you to test it yourself.
- **DualSense Charging Station** - such a simple gadget, yet it brings about such an improvement to the charging task.
- **Steam Deck OLED White Limited Edition** - there seems to be a consensus in the gaming community that a handheld console with a performance similar to PS4, running even big AAA titles, is awesome. I agree. Finally, maybe I play through my Steam pile of shame.
- **LG OLED 48C21LA** - I don't watch TV, so I bought it mainly for consoles. The TV offers a 120Hz refresh rate, 4k, HDR, and VRR, so it can fully utilize PlayStation 5 potential. All the content looks good on the OLED panel. Overall, I think it's a great bang for your buck.
- **Chemex Coffee Maker** - a jug in the form of an hourglass for coffee making. It takes a minute for the coffee to pour over the filter, but it's really clear.
- **Bialetti Moka Pot** - in 1933, Alfonso Bialetti invented the Moka Pot and named it after the city of Mocha, in Yemen, renowned for the quality of its coffee. I use its successor for the induction hob.
- **A safety razor** - I shave like my grandfather. I was surprised at how clean shaved my face can be using it. But it requires patience and caution. And I also reduce plastic waste a bit.
