A codebase for my [website](https://gorzelinski.com), [blog](https://gorzelinski.com/blog/), and [portfolio](https://gorzelinski.com/portfolio/). They are designed, coded, and written by me - [Matthew Gorzelinski](https://gorzelinski.com/about/).

"If it ain't broke, don't fix it," people say. Even though my previous website was working pretty well, working _on it_ became harder and harder. That's why I migrated to a new tech stack.

## üöÄ Getting started

### Prerequisites

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) runtime environment installed on your machine.

### Installation

Running this website locally is pretty simple:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result

### Epilogue

Here, I gave you the full instructions. My website is (and will be) open-source. You can clone it, experiment with it, or even steal ideas from it. I would even encourage that. David Bowie said, "The only art I'll ever study is stuff I can steal from." I don't know if that's an art, but I'll be flattered if you take inspiration from my work. Don't just copy-paste the whole thing and claim it's your own, ok? The fun part is in the discovery, figuring out things on your own. I write about my journey on this very website.

## üìù Content

If you're reading this file, there is a high chance you're a nerd like me. And even if you're not, and you're here by mistake, you may find something interesting on my website. That's because I write about many eclectic things that currently interest me. I elaborated more about topics in my first post - [Hello... world?](https://gorzelinski.com/blog/hello-world/) You may start there and decide on your own. Another posts that may interest you by a category:

- [Design](https://gorzelinski.com/blog/stylish-design-principles-with-a-nasty-acronym/)
- [Writing](https://gorzelinski.com/blog/the-craft-of-writing/)
- [Coding](https://gorzelinski.com/blog/object-oriented-programming-in-javascript/)

You can also check my portfolio. There are [case studies](https://gorzelinski.com/portfolio/gorzelinski/) from projects I worked on. It's a bit poor there, but I'll try to enrich it in the future.

## ü§ù Contributions

Let me know if something is broken or doesn't work as expected. New ideas for improvements are also welcome. You can open an [issue](https://github.com/gorzelinski/gorzelinski.com/issues) or [fork](https://github.com/gorzelinski/gorzelinski.com) the repo and create a [pull request](https://github.com/gorzelinski/gorzelinski.com/pulls). It's my personal pet project, and I usually work on it alone, but that shouldn't stop you from contributing.
